Cyrus Innovation code test in Python

See http://www.cyrusinnovation.com/code-test-java/ to learn what that means.

Note that I'm playing around with Python here, and not necessarily writing
good (clean, idiomatic) code.

I do have a Java version, but I don't plan to post it publicly,
because I believe Cyrus still uses the test.
If you need to see it for some reason, let me know!
